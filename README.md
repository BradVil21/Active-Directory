# Setting Up an Active Directory Environment

**Introduction:** _The goal of this project is to learn how to install and configure Active Directory in a virtualized environment using tools like VMware or Hyper-V. By setting up a Domain Controller, configuring DNS, and understanding the role of Active Directory, this project will provide the foundational knowledge needed for managing users, groups, and resources in a networked environment._

Throughout this project, I'll gain hands-on experience with the following concepts and skills:

* Domain Setup: Learn how to create an Active Directory domain and understand its structure and components.
* Configuring DNS for AD: Understand the importance of DNS in an AD environment and set it up to ensure proper communication between servers and clients.
* Promoting a Server to Domain Controller: Discover how to promote a server to a Domain Controller, which is responsible for managing authentication, user accounts, and network security within the domain.
* Understanding AD's Role in Networked Environments: Gain insight into how Active Directory is used to centralize identity management, control access to resources, and enforce security policies across a network.

**Tools:** To complete this project, I will use the following tools:

Windows Server: The operating system used to install and configure Active Directory.
Oracle VirtualBox: Virtualization software that allows you to create isolated virtual machines to simulate a real-world networked environment for Active Directory.

**Step 1: Installation**
Before diving into the good stuff it is important to install a virtual machine and Windows ISO image file.
